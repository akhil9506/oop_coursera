Welcome to this project, it's me, Abraham Ferrero and I'm going to show you where my actual work has been done:
Inside the /src folder, you will find several folders named from "module1" to "module 6". There are some java classes inside. Anywhere
you see a "TO DO" mark, and some instructions, is where the code has been made just by me, the actual work. 
If you don't find it easily just ask me and I will guide you through the project.

This is part of the first course (6 weeks) coursera course called "Object Oriented Programming in Java"

unfolding_app_template and UC San Diego/Coursera MOOC starter code
==================================================================

This is a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
code for the Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by 
UC San Diego through Coursera.

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.

Get excited and make things!
